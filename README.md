# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

For this week's homework, I builT a timed code quiz that's made up of multiple-choice questions. This app run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. 

I created an array and passing the number, questions, options, and answers
if startQuiz button clicked
show quiz box & calling showQestions function & passing 1 parameter to queCounter & calling startTimer function
I also created a quit quiz button, allow use quit and reload the current window

question was stored in an array
I created a new span and div tag for question and option and passing the value using array index

if user clicked on option is equal to array's correct answer
upgrading score value with 1 & adding green color/thick icon to correct selected option
else adding red color to correct selected option

if there is an option which is matched to an array answer
adding green color to matched option

once user select an option then disabled all options
show the next button if user selected any option

if user scored more than 3/ more than 1/ less than 1
show different texts

changing the value of timeCount with time value
